It targets learning the knowledge\/skills in a consistent and balanced way\n- Every sheet page is on average harder than the previous sheet page\n- This is my recommended way, though most camps\/training-approaches don't use this style\n\n- B) Topics-Based training style\n- See sheet page (Topics). It has the same sheet problems (A to D3) ordered by category and level, around 950 problems\n- Ideas Quality column: P5 (important), P4(very interesting), P3(interesting), P2(good), P1(ok), Empty (normal)\n- Say your level is 6\/10, and solved a problem of level 3 with P5, you will find it a normal one. So notice, it is subjective to your level\/background\n- You can train using Blind-Order, and use Topics page as guide to skip some problems\n- Many guys\/training camps are fan of this topics-based way. \n- You need to be careful with such style as it may corrupt your training quality, e.g. due to your bias\n- Advantage: Mastering the algorithm till solving some hard problems in a short time\n- Disadvantage: Discovering the algorithm behind the problem is an important skill. Given that you know the topic, you lose a good space to improve this skill\n- Disadvantage: Being in the mode of specific algorithm lets you solve many of it easier. However, when solving in real contests, your mind is not so active on the specific topic\n- It is still a good training roadmap. Actually used by most of people I think.",
